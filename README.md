# OOP Exercises in Java
This repository contains a collection of Java programs that demonstrate the use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. These programs were written as part of university homework assignments and cover various OOP concepts such as classes, inheritance, and polymorphism.

# How to run the code

# Exercises


### 1) Exercise 1:
 
* Define a class called Student (Student.java) . Each student has a name and a total number of points obtained at the exams. Define an appropriate constructor and four methods: getName() which returns the name of a student; addExam(int mark) which adds the mark for each exam; getTotal() which obtains the total number of points; getMeanMark(), which returns the mean of all marks.
* Define a class that will contain the main method and create 1 instance  for Student objects, compute  and display for this object the name of student, total number of points and mean of all marks.
 * Define a class called Product (Product.java). Each product has a name and a price (in ROL). Write the constructor and the following methods: displayProduct(), getPrice() and setPrice(). Add two other methods: getPriceInRON() and setPriceInRON() which handles RONs.

 * Define a class that will contain the main method and creates two products and displays them (in ROLs), then raises their prices with 10.25 RON, displays them again (in RONs) and finally only their prices in RONs.

### 2) Exercise 2:
* Define a five classes called:
    * University (University.java), 
    * Author (Author.java),
    * Publication (Publication.java),
    * Journal (Journal.java)
    * ConferenceProceeding (ConferenceProceeding.java)
* Define another class, called UniversityTest (UniversityTest.java), which will include main method, for compute the score. For details please read Instructions.pdf.

### 3) Exercise 3:
* Define a four classes called: 
   * Form (Form.java),
   * Point (Point.java),
   * Circle (Circle.java), 
   * Cylinder (Cylinder.java). 
* Define another class, called FormTest (FormTest.java), which will include main method, for testing form operations. For details please read Instructions.pdf.
